## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Aboveground Petroleum, Oil and Lubricant (POL) storage areas are common in manufacturing and government facilities. They fall under critical infrastructure for transportation (e.g. vehicles, ships and aircraft) and manufacturing industries (e.g. refineries, power stations, manufacturing). 
 
Deep Learning can automatically detect the number, size, and type of POL storage present on a site. This can help monitor the state of aboveground fuel storage tanks, including preventing spills, overfills, and corrosion.

The following business use cases can be identified: 

* Detect POL storage area to subsequently monitor the site for safety or environmental issues (e.g. fire hazard)
* Countries try to keep their oil reserves and production a secret. However, oil prices have a significant influence on the prices of all commodities. POL storage area detection would allow higher transparency leading to a potential competitive advantage. 

There are different companies that already target these business cases: 
* [Planet](https://www.planet.com)
* [Orbitalinsights](https://www.oribitalinsights.com)

## Built With

This project is based on the following core technologies: 

* [Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
